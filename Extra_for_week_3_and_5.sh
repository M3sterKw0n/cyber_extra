A FEW MONTHS ago, WNBA player Elizabeth Williams might not have posted the photo to her Instagram account. A few years ago, she might not have gone to the Black Lives Matter protest on June 3 at Centennial Park in downtown Atlanta.

"She's not usually the one to be the first out there, to put her name or her face out there," says Jaimee Stoner, Williams' friend. "Not because she doesn't care. That's just her personality."

Williams plays for the Atlanta Dream, a franchise in the birthplace of Martin Luther King Jr. The team is named for his famous "I Have a Dream" speech, which he gave 57 years ago, on Aug. 28, 1963. And like so many others -- before much of professional sports shut down Wednesday in protest of the police shooting of Jacob Blake -- she had been deeply affected by the police killings of Black Americans such as George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and she wanted to do something about it.

With mask on and hands up, Williams walked the streets of Atlanta, chanting and pleading for social justice. The longer she marched toward the Georgia State Capitol, the louder her normally quiet voice grew. Stoner pulled out a phone and discreetly snapped a picture.

"I just wanted her to be able to see for herself, 'Look at how powerful it is when you speak up, when you show up, when you're using your platform,'" Stoner says. "And you can feel that in this photo."

When they got home from the march, she showed the black-and-white photo to Williams.

cat > ~/My_Extra/Unit_3/Exercise_3/ESPN/Art1c.txt <<EOF
Williams' long arms are raised plaintively along with those of thousands of others as the marchers chant, "Hands Up, Don't Shoot." Her face, partially hidden behind a mask, is serious. Her "Equality" shirt stands out among a group of homemade signs. The tips of three tall buildings and a crane peek out from behind her, jagged and dissonant.

Williams posted it to her IG account with the Black Lives Matter hashtag. The evocative photo struck a chord, and Williams has a pretty good idea why.

"I see people not just wanting change but demanding it," Williams says. "I also see history repeating itself. That's why I liked it in black and white, because these protests aren't new.

"And I see a combination of bravery, with a little bit of fear."

Little did Williams know that just a month later she would be using her voice to stand up to and campaign against the owner of her WNBA team, U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), who, in a letter to commissioner Cathy Engelbert on July 7, objected to the league's embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement.

In part, the letter read: "I believe it is totally misaligned with the values and goals of the WNBA and the Atlanta Dream, where we support tolerance and inclusion. ... This is not a political movement that the league should be embracing, and I emphatically oppose it."

For a league that had spent months planning how to make its season feel meaningful amid the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide protests, the letter was a dagger to the heart of what the WNBA and its players had just declared they cared about most.

I have been following the bug bounty and security creator/influencer scenes since they started. And as someone in security who also creates content, I feel very close to it all. What I’ve seen in the last year has been troubling.

I keep seeing friends and associates—both in conversations and in social media—crumble under the relentless pressure to produce.

I might see someone publicly emote positivity and energy, and then ten minutes later—somewhere else on the internet—see them describe how unhappy they are.

What people don’t realize when they get into bounty and/or content creation is that the very reason you’re participating is also the thing that causes the suffering. Namely—the squirt of happiness and validation that comes when someone likes your bug, when you get paid for a bug, or when someone enjoys a piece of content you just released.
EOF

cat > ~/My_Extra/Unit_3/Exercise_4/DirA/daniel2.txt <<EOF
People in the bounty and content creation games are deeply embedded in the community, so they’re constantly seeing the work of others. If they got a cool bug yesterday, and got praise from the community, then today they’ll see three of their colleagues get a new bug. And they’ll see them be praised for that.

Now their win from yesterday is gone, and they feel deflated and unloved.

Now they have to hurry up! What’s the next video they can make? What’s the next blog they can write? What’s the next bug they can find?

This takes the things they love most—hacking and sharing content—and turns them into weapons of self-harm.

Soon they’re finding themselves avoiding creating content at all, or looking for bugs, because the whole cycle of idea, creation, publish, and wait for praise has been tainted with negativity.

Here’s what I recommend.

    Monitor your mental state closely, week to week and month to month. Consider journaling to accomplish this, so you can see what you were actually feeling vs. what you remember after the fact, and be honest with yourself when you write.
    Think about what is forcing you to hunt/create. If it’s stress around money, consider getting at least a part-time gig that can alleviate that financial burden. And if it’s feeling inadequate from watching all the other great hunters/creators out there, stop paying so much attention to what they’re doing and focus more on your own work and craft. Set a time limit for time on Twitter per day, say, 15 minutes to respond to direct queries and give some high-fives.
    Explore books and articles that are related to your space but not part of the scene. So if you’re into OSINT or Recon, learn about threading options in Go, or take a course on Python 3. Or get on YouTube and follow some people talking about Python, Bash, and Vim. In other words, do a deep dive on subjects that will enhance your craft without directly being part of it.

No matter what, make sure that you’re having fun. Never forget that your enjoyment of the activity is the true source of both your skill and your happiness.

I think so much of life is about bell curves. And by that I mean, so much of life is about a thing generally being good or bad, but the extremes being different.

I think Nationalism is one of those things.

It’s easy to see where it’s bad to have too much, e.g., the late 1930s, but it’s harder to see that having too little is bad as well.

This also works for overeating.

I think the US has had too little for two or three decades, and when you have too little of a good thing it tends to open the door for having too much.

Trumpism is too much. Like, off the scale too much. Like, 1940’s Europe too much.

Maybe the easiest way to tame a “too much” situation is to encourage the “right amount” situation. Like changing your relationship with food from binging at fast-food restaurants to researching and cooking your own meals.
EOF

cat > ~/My_Extra/Unit_3/Exercise_4/DirA/daniel5.txt <<EOF
And even more surprising, I think it’s possible to do that with Nationalism. I think there’s a benign form, and for the US that might look something like this.

    Americans don’t tolerate racism.
    American’s don’t tolerate sexism.
    Americans believe everyone should be provided a decent, affordable education.
    Americans believe everyone should be provided decent, affordable healthcare.
    Americans believe that their success is tied to the success of their fellow Americans.

That wasn’t hard. It took me 90 seconds to create a positive form of Nationalism.

Are those leftist ideals? Or are they Nationalist? Or are they right-leaning because they’re about social cohesion? I think they can be all three at the same time, and that’s ok.

If America wants to survive, it has to be about something. It needs an identity. That’s obvious of any organization, regardless of alignment. The question is, once you’re aligned, what are you aligned towards?

Email service provider Sendgrid is grappling with an unusually large number of customer accounts whose passwords have been cracked, sold to spammers, and abused for sending phishing and email malware attacks. Sendgrid’s parent company Twilio says it is working on a plan to require multi-factor authentication for all of its customers, but that solution may not come fast enough for organizations having trouble dealing with the fallout in the meantime.

Many companies use Sendgrid to communicate with their customers via email, or else pay marketing firms to do that on their behalf using Sendgrid’s systems. Sendgrid takes steps to validate that new customers are legitimate businesses, and that emails sent through its platform carry the proper digital signatures that other companies can use to validate that the messages have been authorized by its customers.
EOF

cat > ~/My_Extra/Unit_3/Exercise_4/DirB/krebs2.txt <<EOF
But this also means when a Sendgrid customer account gets hacked and used to send malware or phishing scams, the threat is particularly acute because a large number of organizations allow email from Sendgrid’s systems to sail through their spam-filtering systems.

To make matters worse, links included in emails sent through Sendgrid are obfuscated (mainly for tracking deliverability and other metrics), so it is not immediately clear to recipients where on the Internet they will be taken when they click.
EOF

cat > ~/My_Extra/Unit_3/Exercise_4/DirB/krebs3.txt <<EOF
Dealing with compromised customer accounts is a constant challenge for any organization doing business online today, and certainly Sendgrid is not the only email marketing platform dealing with this problem. But according to multiple emails from readers, recent threads on several anti-spam discussion lists, and interviews with people in the anti-spam community, over the past few months there has been a marked increase in malicious, phishous and outright spammy email being blasted out via Sendgrid’s servers.

Rob McEwen is CEO of Invaluement.com, an anti-spam firm whose data on junk email trends are used to improve the spam-blocking technologies deployed by several Fortune 100 companies. McEwen said no other email service provider has come close to generating the volume of spam that’s been emanating from Sendgrid accounts lately.

cat > ~/My_Extra/Unit_3/Exercise_4/DirB/krebs4.txt <<EOF
“As far as the nasty criminal phishes and viruses, I think there’s not even a close second in terms of how bad it’s been with Sendgrid over the past few months,” he said.

Trying to filter out bad emails coming from a major email provider that so many legitimate companies rely upon to reach their customers can be a dicey business. If you filter the emails too aggressively you end up with an unacceptable number of “false positives,” i.e., benign or even desirable emails that get flagged as spam and sent to the junk folder or blocked altogether.

Yesterday’s piece told the tale of Hieu Minh Ngo, a hacker the U.S. Secret Service described as someone who caused more material financial harm to more Americans than any other convicted cybercriminal. Ngo was recently deported back to his home country after serving more than seven years in prison for running multiple identity theft services. He now says he wants to use his experience to convince other cybercriminals to use their skills for good. Here’s a look at what happened after he got busted.

Part I of this series ended with Ngo in handcuffs after disembarking a flight from his native Vietnam to Guam, where he believed he was going to meet another cybercriminal who’d promised to hook him up with the mother of all consumer data caches.

Ngo had been making more than $125,000 a month reselling ill-gotten access to some of the biggest data brokers on the planet. But the Secret Service discovered his various accounts at these data brokers and had them shut down one by one. Ngo became obsessed with restarting his business and maintaining his previous income. By this time, his ID theft services had earned roughly USD $3 million.
EOF

cat > ~/My_Extra/Unit_3/Exercise_4/DirC/krebs6.txt <<EOF
In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Ngo said he spent about two months in a Guam jail awaiting transfer to the United States. A month passed before he was allowed a 10 minute phone call to his family and explain what he’d gotten himself into.

“This was a very tough time,” Ngo said. “They were so sad and they were crying a lot.”

First stop on his prosecution tour was New Jersey, where he ultimately pleaded guilty to hacking into MicroBilt, the first of several data brokers whose consumer databases would power different iterations of his identity theft service over the years.

Next came New Hampshire, where another guilty plea forced him to testify in three different trials against identity thieves who had used his services for years. Among them was Lance Ealy, a serial ID thief from Dayton, Ohio who used Ngo’s service to purchase more than 350 “fullz” — a term used to describe a package of everything one would need to steal someone’s identity, including their Social Security number, mother’s maiden name, birth date, address, phone number, email address, bank account information and passwords.
EOF

cat > ~/My_Extra/Unit_3/Exercise_4/DirC/krebs7.txt <<EOF
Ealy used Ngo’s service primarily to conduct tax refund fraud with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), claiming huge refunds in the names of ID theft victims who first learned of the fraud when they went to file their taxes and found someone else had beat them to it.

Ngo’s cooperation with the government ultimately led to 20 arrests, with a dozen of those defendants lured into the open by O’Neill and other Secret Service agents posing as Ngo.

The Secret Service had difficulty pinning down the exact amount of financial damage inflicted by Ngo’s various ID theft services over the years, primarily because those services only kept records of what customers searched for — not which records they purchased.

But based on the records they did have, the government estimated that Ngo’s service enabled approximately $1.1 billion in new account fraud at banks and retailers throughout the United States, and roughly $64 million in tax refund fraud with the states and the IRS.

 (CNN)Anita Hill never pictured herself voting for Joe Biden.
But given the political reality the nation is facing, she's not only going to vote for Biden -- she's also willing to work with him, should he become president.
"Notwithstanding all of his limitations in the past, and the mistakes that he made in the past, notwithstanding those -- at this point, between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, I think Joe Biden is the person who should be elected in November," Hill told CNN's Gloria Borger. But it's not just because he's running against Donald Trump, she adds. "Its more about the survivors of gender violence. That's really what it's about."
And if that means voting for and working with Joe Biden, then "so be it."

"My commitment is to finding solutions, and I am more than willing to work with him," Hill said. She'd like to work on issues of sexual harassment, gender violence and gender discrimination.
Hill and Biden have a troubled history dating back nearly three decades: In 1991, Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and oversaw the confirmation hearing of then-US Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Hill was the star witness, testifying that Thomas sexually harassed her when they worked together at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Thomas denied the allegations.
Hill said those hearings permanently altered her life.
For Hill, the public declaration of a willingness to work inside government is a sea change.
"One of the impacts of 1991 was my desire not to really work with the government in any way," Hill said. "I always said, I think I can be more effective as an outsider, as opposed to an insider. And now, I'm willing to evolve myself, to work for change inside."
Hill insisted this is bigger than her -- and bigger than Biden.
